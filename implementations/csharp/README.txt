Starting from DSTU, this project only contains the generated class files representing the Fhir Resources and datatypes.

All other functionality (parsing, serializing, profile validation, etc) is part of the open-source FHIR
support library which can be obtained by NuGet. 

You can find the source code for the support API at http://github.com/ewoutkramer/fhir-net-api.
